# Reading Text from file

  

## Why did I make this script? 
I am using this to copy and paste parts of my online textbook I have to read and some random news articles into the putTextHere.txt to get out of reading and have the text read to me. 

  

## Instructions

- Download Repo

- copy and paste text into putTextHere.txt

- run the following command

---
	python3 run.py
